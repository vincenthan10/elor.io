<!--TO DO: 
-make ZombieFlame chase the player, fix collision bugs (i think hitbox still works like a circle?), maybe add new drops
-add weight to enemies and player (just not fire patches). collision between bodies will cause knockback for both enemy and player even when shielded. collision between enemy and enemy will not knockback. enemies can walk through fire patches. sword causes knockback for enemy but not player. sword does not knockback firepatch
