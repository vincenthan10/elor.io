<!--TO DO: 
- fix player not damage delay for several enemies
- make firepatch always be higher layer than other enemies
-add weight to enemies and player (just not fire patches). collision between bodies will cause knockback for both enemy and player even when shielded. collision between enemy and enemy will not knockback. enemies can walk through fire patches. sword causes knockback for enemy but not player. sword does not knockback firepatch
-add new drop to zombieflame: fireshard and mysteriousflame -> can unlock new spells from a certain amount
