<!--TO DO: 
- make upgrade button clickable like inventory (can only be opened with keyboard right now, not mouse) and make it so player doesn't swing while clicking inside menu just like inventory
- make it so that holding left click can make you continue swinging
- make it so that you can swing and shield simultaneously with keys
- add more drops from higher rarity fires
