This is a slowly working in progress project on a 2D browser game, elor.io, inspired by florr.io. This is my first time using JavaScript and I have used AI and other online resources as tools to help me learn the language. Currently, the structure of my code needs a huge revamp so that it will be much easier to add other entities to the game.

You are a warrior. You can use arrow keys, or WASD, or your mouse to move, using Q to toggle between keyboard and mouse movement. The objective of the game is explore the (currently small) world of elor and destroy as many monsters/mobs (haven't fully decided on the general name for the enemies yet), collect their loot, and use them to craft stronger equipment and learn various magic spells. 
The eventual plan is for players' progress to be saved just like in florr.io and add multiplayer. But for now, I am still working on the core mechanics of the game.
